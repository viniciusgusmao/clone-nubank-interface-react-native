# Clone Nubank Interface

> This is a demonstration of some screens and features of the Nubank app. I used React Native as a development framework.

## Motivation

This implementation was initially created by the excellent developer called **Diego Fernandes**, from the company **Rocketseat**. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDm0M_rZLJo)

My goal in replicating this implementation again was to reinforce my learning in React Native, in addition to getting to know more about animations in RN.
